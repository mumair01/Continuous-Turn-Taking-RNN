# Continuous Model of Turn-Taking using LSTM RNNs

## About

This project is my implementation of a continuous predictive model
for turn-taking based on Skantze's 2017 [paper](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1141130/FULLTEXT01.pdf). The goal is to use this implementation to reproduce the results achieved in the original model and use it as a baseline for future improvements.
